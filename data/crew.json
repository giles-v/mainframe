Linshi was serving as a trans-species, full spectrum interpreter for the Mercantile Sphere (MS) while they attempted to renegotiate the terms of their trade partnership. As the discussions progressed Linshi realised that Commander PsiTech, hired as mercenary bodyguard to the First Tanchan Prelate, was being wilfully misguided by his assigned translator, with the probable intent of providing a casus beli for the MS.\n\nLinshi broke her neutrality, threatening her reputation as a trusted intermediary, and instructed the Commanmder in secret in the proper forms of address and customary signs of respect. The Nexus was able to withdraw from its contract without incident merely days before the MS destroyed the Tanchan orbital shipyards and laid seige to the planet. Linshi has remained with the Nexus ever since, steering Commander PsiTech through the nuances of strange and alien social interactions>"

Unwillingly took part in several of the massacres for which the Scorched Void were known for, including overloading his ship's core drive to generate a plasma torch capable of igniting a planet's atmosphere. Indirectly responsible for the deaths of 17 billion colonists the fleet laid waste to the Hecarine system.\n\nAfter the Spiral Coallition defeated the 6th fleet's at the battle of Idiran, in which Commander PsiTech fought as a rogue element, the Subject's escape pod was picked up by the Nexus and he willingly joined the crew. His steadfast loyalty is born partly out of respect and partly out of fear that the Scorched Void will reform and attempt to re-conscript him. PsiTech has assured him he will not stand alone should that day come."

No-one remembers exactly how iota came to join the crew, as the away team who went down to the colony that day ended up in a drinking contest with an android that not only brewed his own perfectly distilled, neurally destructive moonshine, but was fitted with a high-end artificial liver implant. By the time they stumbled back aboard the Nexus iota had granted herself root access to the Nexus Mainframe and was casually tinkering with the gestural interface. The first person to question her presence soon found that the only way to unlock their crew quarters was to seductively undress in the corridor. Since then iota has proved herself a valuable team member and a useful adjunct to AI Nereid's capabilities, especially when hacker skills are needed for an off-ship mission."

Rodek the Far-Sighted-Seer died giving birth to her only child, a healthy bouncing boy.  Lacking maternal guidance and gender predisposition, ZuArt was never expected to develop any psychic ability.  Early manifestations of his gift were misinterpreted as spying and dropping of eaves (from which he gained the nickname Techo).  After being accused of being a peeping Tom, ZuArt was locked away in isolation.  He was later released without conditions, after he accurately predicted the demise of a village elder in a freak accident involving the birthing of a Heilan Heffer, late at night, by candlelight.  It transpired that the cow was a phantom birth, and three months of pent up gas were released instead./n/nZuArt’s greatest prediction was the destruction of his own planet.  He foresaw that an extraterrestrial object would hurtle into the planet, sending it onto a direct collision course with the planet’s sun. Ships were duly constructed (have you witnessed the Ethellian project methodology?), lists drawn of the great & good to carry on the genetic seed and, on the day that Hillary’s comet appeared on the horizon, ships were boarded, and the fleet departed.\n\nOn witnessing the comet passing Ethel with a wide berth the elders cursed ZuArt furiously. The fleet returned, and the ships were unduly decommissioned (the Ethellians revel in deconstruction). ZuArt was banished to orbit the planet for a year and a day, to think upon the disruption that he had caused. On the day of his scheduled return home, an interstellar cruiser, the largest of its kind, was hijacked by joyriders. They had cracked the ships password ‘Picard123', hacked the AI, put the cruiser into manual, and made off at maximum speed.  The cruiser’s AI fought back valiantly, locking the joyriders out, but was unable to override the manual controls.  Nothing could be done to stop the cruiser colliding with Ethel, the planet was sent into a spin, and in turn Ethel collided with its sun.  The joyriders escaped in a shuttle, and are still at large.  ZuArt was the only member of his race to survive."

She generally has more affinity for creatures than people, and is happiest when getting to know an individual creature or a new species.  Her curiosity about new lifeforms often landed her in trouble with her people, and after getting caught trespassing one too many times tracking elusive winged reptiles, she hitched a ride with a passing trader and left her homeworld.  At least that’s what she tells people - she tends to skip the part about some rather unwise experiments involving animal hybrids that didn’t quite go to plan.\n\nWhile she misses the forests of Ascarth, she is happy to be exploring the universe as there are so many creatures out there to discover.  Early in her travels she decided to formalise her knowledge of Xenobiology, obtained a doctorate, and met her lover India Kaleri. Xan now works on the Nexus, studying (and sometimes experimenting on) the creatures they encounter."

She was training to be a veterinarian when she caught a rare virus and never completed her studies. Instead she turned her talents to operating on humanoids. A lack of training, combined with never having actually taken the Hippocratic Oath, has left her free to willingly medicate herself and others whenever the opportunity presents itself. She is a gifted medic however, if a little unscrupulous. She met Xan Talon while studying and they quickly hit it off, shortly becoming lovers, and have been inseparable since.\n\nWhile pursuing a bounty hunting contract on a space station in the Demari Nebula, PsiTech took a toxin shard from a Leanthine needler to the guy. India came to the rescue, knocking out the assassin with a little concoction of her which she'd been dying to field test. India and Xan were invited to join the Nexus team, and India has made herself useful on many occasions patching up crew members after violent encounters, or overseeing recreational bouts of pharmaceutical experimentation."

The signal was broadcast in the clear, without encryption or interface protocols, and contained only beautiful music, sung to the stars. PsiTech ordered an immediate change of course to investigate and found a small colony living below the frozen surface. Born during the long years of the ice age, Aos had known only darkness and privation. Her broadcasts were a cry for change by any means; even destruction was better than the lifeless tedium on Sentar. Impressed by both her ability to organise habitation under such conditions, PsiTech invited Aos to join the Nexus as Operations Officer, trading her practical management skills for a limitless view of the universe by his side."

While refuelling from the gas clouds of Uranus, they were ambushed by a stealth interceptor of unknown origin. Broadsided by enervation beams, the Cylactica soon lost all power and was boarded by a brutal race of alien vampire warlords. They mercilessly slaughtered the entire crew, except for Logos, who used her superior knowledge of the ship to evade capture. Traumatised by the death of her crew, and desperate to flee the doomed ship, she found an escape shuttle with a functioning reserve battery and managed to launch herself in the direction of Earth.\n\nStranded on the planet, she lived there for some time, surviving through imitation and infiltration, but desperately wishing for contact and rescue from a more enlightened civilisation. Shortly after taking command of The Nexus Psitech was operating on Earth as a deep undercover agent. When hostile activity forced the AI Neried to break orbit he had become separated from his ship, his crew and his logistics network. He had no-one to trust until a chance meeting threw Psitech and Logos together. They immediately recognised each other as aliens in a world of humans and formed an unshakeable bond. Working together, they located the Nexus and reunited the Commander with his crew. Psitech evacuated Logos from Earth and she in turn became a loyal and faithful comrade."

Young Otilarks are clumsy and not very convincing as fourth dimensional beings, but every 366 solar years they return to their original form outside space and time to process what they have learned, then return as a newer and more capable version. An Otilark increments its build number by 1 for each learning cycle and .1 for each regenerative meditation within that learning cycle. Dante's extremely high build number indicates that he is now so good at being human, he is almost indistinguishable from the real thing. As a result of painstakingly advancing his understanding of anatomy, he has become an unparalleled master of unarmed combat. He is very patient when trying to impart his physical skills to his crewmates.\n\nHe finds the adventures of the Nexus so entertaining that he does not wish to forget any details when he shrugs off his body and mind at the end of this learning cycle, a mere 92 years into the future. Therefore he keeps meticulous records on quantum carbon nanotablets which he intends to review as soon as he returns to the material universe as Dante Build 11.0."

She enjoyed an idyllic childhood and excelled at most academic subjects while developing a particular  fascination for organic interface technology. Due to her intellectual aptitude and her uncle's wealth, after leaving school she was able to advance her studies at a prestigious university. Jandia was most of the way through completing a higher doctorate in human cryonics when she heard that her uncle had been bankrupted following a tax audit, and had sold her into slavery in an attempt to reduce his time in debtor's prison.\n\nDeciding that she valued her freedom above the law, Jandia fled before the authorities could seize her as lost property. To support herself she advertised her considerable skills on the black market. Warned repeatedly by the AI Nereid about the dire condition of the cryostasis pods on the Nexus, Commander Psitech hired Jandia for a rapid review and repair job. He was so impressed by her efficiency and mechanical creativity that he invited her to remain on the ship as crew. She jumped at the chance to travel far from Kalumnia and apply her abilities to repairing the fascinatingly original forms of damage which the Nexus frequently sustains. Jandia is a quiet, gentle and rather shy girl who has learned to enjoy her new life in space. Her consistent yet intelligent optimism, as much as her technical ability, has won her the respect of her crewmates."
